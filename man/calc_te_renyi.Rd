\title{Function that calculates the transfer entropy between two time series x and
y. The information flow from y to x is measured. Change x and y in function
call to infer the dominant direction of the information flow. Calculated
transfer entropy measure is Renyi transfer entropy.}
\usage{
calc_te_renyi(x, lx, y, ly, q)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{a vector of coded values}

\item{lx}{Markov order of x}

\item{y}{a vector of coded values}

\item{ly}{Markov order of y}

\item{q}{weighting parameter in Renyi transfer entropy}
}
\value{
returns a list
